Detection and Alert Generation Thresholds Explanation
------------------------------------------------------

1. Detection Process:
   -------------------
   - The system uses an ONNX model to detect various types of garbage in real-time from a camera feed.
   - Each frame is processed to identify objects from 29 predefined garbage classes.
   - For each frame, the model outputs bounding boxes, confidence scores, and predicted class IDs.
   - Detection is only considered valid if:
     - Objectness confidence > 0.5
     - Class confidence > 0.5
   - Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with IoU threshold of 0.4 is applied to reduce overlapping boxes.

2. Firebase Updates:
   ------------------
   For each post office:
   - `/garbageDetectionData/{YYYY-MM-DD}/detections`: Incremented with the number of garbage detections per frame.
   - `/garbageTypeData/{class_id}`: Tracks frequency and type of each detected garbage class.
   - `/detectionTimeTableData`: Logs each detection event with timestamp, location, and garbage type.

3. Alert Threshold Logic:
   -----------------------
   - The system maintains an `alert` count in Firebase for each post office.
   - Every time a new frame is processed, it uses the current `alert` value to determine compliance:
     - `non_compliant_percentage = (alert / 8) * 100`
     - `compliant_percentage = 100 - non_compliant_percentage`
   - These are written to:
     - `/compliant`: percentage of time area is clean
     - `/non-compliant`: percentage of time area had garbage
   - The value `8` is a threshold divisorâ€”representing 8 possible alert intervals or inspection windows.

4. Customizations:
   ------------------
   - Consider raising the threshold confidence or adjusting NMS IoU for stricter detection.
   - Tune the alert threshold logic based on detection severity.

This document is intended to clarify the internal logic of detection and alert computation used for monitoring post office cleanliness.
